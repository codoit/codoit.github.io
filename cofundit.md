# CoFundIt

**CoFundIt** is a non-profit organization which aims to build tools for funding projects together.

Our main goal is to help humans do stuff, any stuff. We, at **CoFundIt**, believe in **stigmergy** and **collaboration**.

## How do we work ?

We are building tools for maintaining an *activity network* funded by a *common pot* where each member of the network can fund any activity (or **node**) in the network.

## How can I join the network ?

For the moment, you can't. This organization is still in early stage. The needed tools aren't developed yet, everything is a *work in progress*.
