# CoMeanIt

**CoMeanIt** is a non-profit organization which aims to build tools for making
decision together.

Our main goal is to help humans to coordinate themselves. We want to get rid of
slow decision making, in order to improve flexibility in a growing network of
people.

## How do we work ?

We are building tools for managing the election and management of an *administrative council*
composed by a subset of the network of people.

## How can I join the network ?

For the moment, you can't. This organization is still in early stage. The needed tools aren't developed yet, everything is a *work in progress*.
