# CoDoIt

**CoDoIt** is a concept defining 3 ideas based on **stigmergy** and **collaboration**:

 - CoThinkIt
 - CoMeanIt
 - CoFundIt

Where **Capitalism** failed to resolve conflicts between *profit* and *humanist*
activities, making difficult to improve their objectives, **CoDoIt** tries a new
approach with **stigmergy**.

# What is Stigmergy ?

**Stigmergy** is a biological mechanism observed from ants and termites, where
individuals act from traces left by other individuals.

This mechanism allows the construction of complex structures without coordination.

Every actions leave a trace, the more traces there is, the more actions there will
be.

## Hierarchical model

When an organization is built on a *hierarchical model*, a **minority** controls the
group and the objective.

![Example of hierarchy](/images/hierarchy.png)

This can lead to frustration from the lower layers, as they are just executing
decisions made by a minority, without any influence on the decision.

## Cooperative model

When an organization is built on a *cooperative model*, the **group** controls individuals
and the objective.

![Example of cooperation](/images/cooperation.png)

This can lead to slow decision making, as the group have to talk until a majority
or unanimity is reached.

The decision will mainly be influenced by charismatic speakers, as they will rally
more people.

## Stigmergic model

When an organization is built on a *stigmergic model*, each **individual** contributes
and forks projects.

In this model:

 - each individual can fork the project to contribute with their own idea: creativity is not inhibited
 - each individual can contribute to any fork: flexibility in the group is improved
 - most promising forks gather more individuals: decision is a consequence, not a cause
 - each model can be simulated within a group of individuals: compatibility with other models is kept 

# Our model

Our model is built on a *stigmergic model* applied to a network of people.

## Key concepts

The model is composed of **members**, and **traces**:

 - projects
 - groups
 - means of project making

**Partners** are people who contribute with less implication and transparency on
projects/groups.

The result is **dynamic**, **flexible** and very **resistant** to failures.

## Key rules

### Autonomous members

**Diversity** is the key point. Like in every biological systems, **balance** is
acquired through **diversity**. With a single mind model, errors could not be raised
soon enough, and could be fatal to any project.

### Common rules defined by a majority of members and a minority of partners

Rules are renewed during an annual **Administrative Council**.
The influence in decisions is distributed among peoples.

Example:

 - 66% of the decision must be taken by members, 34% by partners
 - only 2 members are present, but 8 partners are present
 - each member have ``66 / 2 = 33%`` of influence in the decision
 - each partner have ``34 / 8 = 4.25%`` of influence in the decision

### Trust

Responsibility is shared by all members, which implies an improvement in quality
testing.

### Self-management

Social pressure is a key for auto-rule application among members.
Developing or using tools to ease comunication will ensure self-management.

### Transparency

Freedom of activities improves idea efficiencies, reputation and the network expansion.

### Shared economy and means

It is up to the **Administrative Council** to decide how the network behaves.
Because every one can take part in the decision making, all means for funding
or making projects are shared by all.

### Degrowth

Bigger is the network, lesser is the necessity for the member to provide funding
for common activities.
