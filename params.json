We, at **CoFundIt**, believe in **stigmergy** and **colaboration**.\r\n\r\n## How do we work ?\r\n\r\nWe are building tools for maintaining an *activity network* funded by a *common pot* where each member of the network can fund any activity (or **node**) in the network.\r\n\r\n## How can I join the network ?\r\n\r\nFor the moment, you can't. This organization is still in early stage. The needed tools aren't developed yet, everything is a *work in progress*.",
